# Workz Ventures — Enhanced AI-Driven Buyer & Marketing Agency

## Original problem statement
Build an enterprise platform that combines:
- Composio OAuth for LinkedIn + other professional networks
- JWT-based registration/login with RBAC
- WebMCP declarative + imperative tasks exposed via `data-mcp-action` and `navigator.mcpActions.register()` for AI browsing agents (Claude in Chrome, LangChain, Hermes)
- Buyer Research Hub that synthesizes public + market data into AI-curated company briefs
- AI-personalized newsletters with draft/approve/dispatch
- Audit logging, agent activity monitoring, and Composio-managed token gateway

## User choices (Feb 2026 build)
- MVP scope: All features (broader, shallow but functional end-to-end)
- AI model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key
- Auth: JWT email/password
- Composio API key: provided (real); Resend email: MOCKED
- Email delivery: MOCKED only

## Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI · MongoDB · JWT (pyjwt + bcrypt) · `emergentintegrations` (Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM key) · httpx → Composio v3
- **Frontend**: React 19 · React Router · shadcn/ui · sonner toasts · @phosphor-icons/react · Cabinet Grotesk + IBM Plex Sans + JetBrains Mono · dark theme (#08080A + gold #C8A97E)
- **WebMCP**: `navigator.mcpActions.register()` shim + `data-mcp-action` DOM attributes; 9 actions exposed; public manifest at `/api/mcp/manifest`

## User personas
- **Buyer** — institutional investor consuming research + newsletters
- **Analyst** — generates collateral, runs outreach campaigns
- **Admin** — manages connections, audits

## Core requirements (static)
- Enterprise-grade JWT auth with audit trail
- AI research summaries on any company (not just internal portfolio)
- AI-drafted personalized newsletters with approve→dispatch
- WebMCP action surface for autonomous agents
- Composio gateway for LinkedIn OAuth
- Full audit + diagnostics

## What's been implemented (2026-05-20)
- Auth: register, login, /me, RBAC (`buyer | seller | admin`; legacy `analyst` auto-migrated to `buyer`)
- **Role-differentiated workspaces** (added 2026-05-20)
- **Brand integration**: official Workz Ventures lion + wordmark logo across sidebar, landing hero, login splash, register card, and favicon; landing/login backdrop uses the official key visual "Designed for Today · Built for Tomorrow · Focused on Forever"
- **Role-gated nav & routes** (added 2026-05-20)
  - Buyer/Seller no longer see MCP Console or Audit Logs in the sidebar
  - Direct URL access to `/app/mcp` and `/app/audit` is gated to `role === "admin"` via `<AdminOnly>` route wrapper
  - "Composio" page label and nav label renamed to "Integrations" (route `/app/composio` unchanged for compatibility)
  - All user-visible "Claude" mentions replaced with "AI"/"AI researcher" so the underlying LLM can be swapped without rewording the UI
- **Real-time grounded research** (added 2026-05-20)
  - `/api/research/company` now calls Perplexity Sonar Pro (`sonar-pro`) and Brave Search in parallel via `asyncio.gather`, merges deduped numbered sources, then passes the grounded context to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for the final structured brief
  - Brief includes inline `[n]` citations across text fields (market_signals, investor_take, etc.) plus a sources list with title, URL, provider (perplexity/brave), and age
  - Frontend Research Hub shows a "live web research" pill on the brief header and renders a Sources panel with clickable URLs
  - End-to-end latency ~32-35s (within 60s ingress budget); fail-soft if either provider returns an error
- **Role-aware newsletter** (added 2026-05-20)
  - **Buyer** → `POST /api/newsletter/personal` generates AND delivers a Workz-branded personal digest in one call (recipient = self, `kind=personal`, `recipients=1`). UI reframed as "Workz Ventures, curated for you · Send to my inbox".
  - **Seller** → `POST /api/newsletter/draft` (now gated to seller/admin) creates a `kind=broadcast` draft → approve → dispatch fans out to buyer-role opted-in users only. UI reframed as "Reach the entire buyer base · Draft broadcast".
  - Cross-role calls are 403-gated; legacy newsletter docs without `kind` are backfilled to "broadcast" on read.
- **Seller Collateral from listing** (added 2026-05-20): seller-only "Generate from a listing" picker on `/app/collateral` pre-fills deal name, target audience (sector + geography), and key points (summary + financials + highlights) from any of the seller's own listings. Manual entry still works.
- **Deal Room module** (added 2026-05-20)
  - NDA-gated workspace opened per (listing × buyer × seller) inquiry — only available once the seller flips the inquiry to `engaged`
  - **Status lifecycle**: pending_nda → active → closed
  - **DRL templates** (6): SaaS, Healthcare, Industrial, FinServ, ClimateTech, Consumer — buyer picks one; instantly creates a structured request list with workstream tags (finance / legal / hr / it / operations / commercial)
  - **AI auto-matching**: when a seller uploads a file, Claude maps it to the best DRL request and auto-marks the request `satisfied`
  - **AI Findings**: buyer taps "Generate findings" → Claude reads every uploaded file and returns structured findings with severity / workstream / citation (verbatim quote + file id)
  - Audit + agent-activity entries on every action (open, NDA accept, DRL apply, upload, match, findings)
  - 13 new endpoints: `/drl-templates`, `/inquiries/{id}/open-room`, `/deal-rooms` (list + detail), `/accept-nda`, `/drl`, `/files`, `/generate-findings`
  - 4 new Mongo collections: `deal_rooms`, `deal_room_files`, `deal_room_requests`, `deal_room_findings`
  - Frontend: new sidebar entry "Deal Rooms" (under Pipeline) for both buyer + seller; list page + tabbed detail page (Files · DRL · Findings); NDA-acceptance modal; "Open Deal Room" CTA on engaged inquiries; "Deal Room →" link once one exists
- Buyer Research Hub, Marketing Collateral Generator, Outreach, Lead Nurturing, Newsletter (personal + broadcast), MCP Console (admin), Agent Monitor, Integrations (LinkedIn + Zoho CRM via Composio), Audit Logs (admin)
- Backend tests: **73/73 pass** (was 52/52 before Deal Rooms)

## Prioritized backlog
**P1**
- Convert long-running Claude endpoints (research, newsletter) to async job pattern (POST → 202 + job id, GET to poll) for headroom beyond 60s ingress
- Real Resend integration for newsletter dispatch
- Pagination on `/api/agents/activity` and `/api/audit/logs`

**P2**
- Split `server.py` into routers/ modules
- Restrict CORS to known origins
- Add Composio webhook handler for OAuth callback (currently stored as pending)
- Add MORE professional network connectors (Twitter/X, Slack, HubSpot via Composio)
- Add subscription tiers (premium buyers get faster Claude responses / more research credits)

## Seed credentials
See `/app/memory/test_credentials.md` — `alex@workz.example.com / WorkzPass123!`

## Mocked
- Newsletter email dispatch (Resend MOCKED — flips status to `dispatched` + records recipient count)
- Outreach campaign launch (LinkedIn delivery MOCKED — flips status to `launched` + records sent count)
